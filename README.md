# Stuck-At-pattern-generation

I have used Visual Studio Code (VSCode) as my integrated development environment (IDE) to run the Java program. 
The main file is in problem.java and the packages folder contains all the neccessary classes required to generate test pattern like
---circuit.java file is for generating the circuit design as DAG and computing its values for corresponding input vector,also it reads from circuit.txt file and methods to initializes the circuit and it has methods to simulate the circuit.
---testpattern.java file has all the methods to identify fault,generate input vectors and it writes the output to output.txt file.
